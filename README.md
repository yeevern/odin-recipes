# Odin Recipes Project

This repository is attempted at creating a recipes for the Odin Project's foundation course. 

This website was created entirely with HTML and abit of CSS, with no other frameworks or plugins. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of using the fundamental HTML so the website won't look very pretty; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
